# 🌐 Muhammad Zahid | Developer Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio site, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, as part of my ongoing full-stack development journey. I’ve been learning through online resources/communities such as youtube, Udemy, and programs like ASU's **AZNext Web Developer Program** in partnership with Cognizant (July 2025 cohort) and will update site as I further progress.

## What This Project Is

- A responsive portfolio showcasing background, certifications, current skills, and personal projects
- Designed to be clean, readable, PC, mobile-friendly, and easy to maintain (with comments for myself)
- Also used as a place to test out/learn new things, and anything else I learn or break while learning

## What I Learned so far

### GitHub: From Copy-Paste to Cloning Repos

I started out writing code in **Visual Studio Code**, then would manually copy and paste into GitHub’s web editor. It worked good at the time, but it wasn't efficient and required multiple steps.

Additionally, when saving in GitHub web, it asked for a commit message before pushing that looked like a filename, I assumed it might overwrite or create a duplicate file, an amateur mistake, but with further reading and learning, learned it helps maintain a log.

Eventually I installed **GitHub Desktop**, learned how to clone my repository locally, and started pushing directly from VS Code. Writing clear commit messages now helps me track changes better.

Understanding that workflow early saves time and helps feel more in control of versioning.

### Fixing Weird Alignment Was Weirdly Educational

The “Currently Learning” section refused to line up with the rest of the content. What looked like a small CSS issue ended up teaching me a lot about:

- The importance of consistent HTML structure
- The effects of default margin and padding
- HTML validation tool https://validator.w3.org/

Eventually I got it working the way I wanted. Plus, learned another CSS lesson.

## Further mastering

`React ⚛️`, `Node.js 🌐`, `MongoDB 🍃`, `Git ✅`, `Agile 🌀`

---

## Next Steps

- Keep learning !!!
- Add more real-world projects with business logic and deployment
